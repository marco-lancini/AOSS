* AOSS

AOSS (Android-OpenCV Sound Synthesizer) is an Android app, developed for the Image Analysis course at [[http://www.polimi.it][Politecnico di Milano]], that uses the OpenCV libraries to determine the distance between two objects taken by the camera of the phone; distance which will modulate the frequency of the sound produced by the audio synthesizer embedded into the application. 

The aim was indeed to use the output of a process of Computer Vision, as the distance between two objects taken from the device, as input to a subsequent process of audio manipulation, which is an audio synthesizer.

Given as input a real-time video captured by the camera of the phone that shows a white surface (eg a table) and to the above two dark objects, the system must identify these objects and use the distance between them to modulate the frequency of the sound produced by the synthesizer. 

Moreover, the user has the ability to move objects and see how this is reflected in the output: the image of his hands is ignored and the system displays real-time updating of the position of the centers of two objects, in addition to varying the frequency of the sound produced.




** Computer Vision Module

The base of AOSS is a Computer Vision module able to recognize objects and their distance. It's totally auto-contained and can be used as a desktop script, independent from the app.

In the *vision_module* folder there's the source code of this module, equipped with a pre-recorded video that can be used as input for the script (if you want you can just record your own video), and another video that shows the script running.

**** Prerequisites: *OpenCV 2.3.1*
****** official site: http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/Welcome
****** installation guide: http://www.marcolancini.it/other/opencv_install_231.php
   
**** Compilation:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
g++ AOSS_Vision_Module.cpp -o AOSS_Vision_Module `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv`
#+END_SRC

**** Usage:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./AOSS_Vision_Module example_input_video.AVI
#+END_SRC



** Android App

AOSS provides users two ways to use, accessible via a menu:

****** Sound Synthesizer - OFF: disable all the features and shows only what is taken from the camera. No sound is produced.
****** Sound Synthesizer - ON:  the image taken by the camera is forwarded to the Computer Vision logic, that identifies the centers of objects and updates the sound generated by the synthesizer.


In the *android_app* folder there's the source code of the app and the pre-compiled APK ready to be installed.
